# examc

Proof of concept demonstration of a C-header only library using linker sections. 

No clue if this works with any compiler/linker other than GNU :). 

## Usage

Don't use this, this is just an experiment. 

But if you really want to, then see examc_example.c for an example (define tests with EXAMC_TEST, and define the passing condition using EXAMC_CHECK). 

This works by putting each test in a special linker section and taking
advantage of the automatically generated `__start_SECTION` and `__stop_SECTION`
variables generated by gcc. (there are nastier/less-reliable ways to do this if
there are linkers that don't do this, e.g sentinel values). Might try that to
make it work with clang which doesn't seem to define the sections
automatically..
