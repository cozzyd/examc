This example shows how you can spread tests interwoven with library code. You
can add tests in multiple object files, just make sure you #define
EXAMC_NO_MAIN before including examc.h. Then you can link all your object files
into an executable that doesn't have EXAMC_NO_MAIN defined (and can also define
additional tests, of course, but that's not necessary).  Note that in this
case, we aren't linking against the shared library (that would probalby require
fancy relocations or something? I don't know maybe it's easy but I don't know
how to do it offhand), but against the object files. If using a static library,
then obviously you can do that (it's roughly the same thing after all).
